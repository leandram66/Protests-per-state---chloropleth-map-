<p>“I think just showing up and being here is really important in order to show solidarity and so the people of Palestine know in some way that there are people rooting for them and we care for them and we want them to be free,” says protestor, Graciela Garica.


<p>2023 saw countless protests as people from all over the United States came together to fight for fair labor practices and humanitarian causes like Garcia.  
</p>

<p>The most notable protests of this year include the United Auto Workers Strike and The Writers Guild of America Strike which both demanded better pay, benefits and working conditions amongst other things.
</p>

<p>Currently, Pro Palestine and Pro Israel protests are taking the lead as December 7th marks the 2 months since the Hamas attack on Israel, drawing from a long history of war between Palestine and Israel. Many protests are calling for a ceasefire, demanding Israel discontinue their attacks on Palestine. Some of those protestors include activists, community members and journalists.
</p>

<p> “I go to these protests because I recognize that the Palestinian struggle is something that isn't covered very equitably in mass media and in corporate media. As a community journalist  I can't ignore their yells for justice,” says Democracy Now! fellow , Sonyi Lopez.
</p>

<p>From January 1st, 2023 to December 8th, 2023, the US saw a grand total of 12,005 protests and counting. 
</p>

<p> Below are the number of protests per state.</p>

<p>“I think that it's really significant that we're taking time today to show up and also show the action behind our words and what we want out of this movement. We're not free until everybody's free,” says protestor Cam Rogers.</p>
